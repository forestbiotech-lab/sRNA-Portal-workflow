Short-cutted
############
1 - Passing args to post server not as form in ajax as query args instead of form args.
2- Should add bogus security code to be passed. To ensure that it's not abused. Some algorithm based on time. Like steam.
3- Hit enter closes modal.
4- Replace details with button and listener.
5- MiRPursuit panel hidden pop-up only when miRPursuit is running. On click show plus a var to see if miRPursuit is running. 
6- Grab shell process number to know if it's running. Listen for exit code of process
7- Remove multiparty from package.json and uninstall it

-Markdown reports
-Progress in ROOT user folder, tab separated. Percentage xx% State description and number(?)
-First run must have already been done for node to be able to run miRPursuit or else get a work around to say yes and accept conditions.

-Dealing with errors. How to highlight errors. Parse global log or run log for warnings. Set logs to have warnings or fatal warnings whatever.

	Not sure what is the requirement of uniqueness. Unique to machine, database? Depends on deployment strategy.

var exec = require('child_process').exec;
function log(error, stdout, stderr) { console.log(stdout) }
exec("ls -la", log);
