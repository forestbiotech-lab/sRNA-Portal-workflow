Short-cutted
############
1 - Passing args to post server not as form in ajax as query args instead of form args.
2- Should add bogus security code to be passed. To ensure that it's not abused. Some algorithm based on time. Like steam.
3- Hit enter closes modal.
4- Replace details with button and listener.
5- MiRPursuit panel hidden pop-up only when miRPursuit is running(Done). On click show plus a var to see if miRPursuit is running (Where?). Issues with closing side panel.
6- Grab shell process number to know if it's running. Listen for exit code of process
7- Is Mirpursuit still running when page is refreshed?
8- Deal with problems if log folder doesn't exist yet. Any how this panel will be absent before running. 

MiRPursuit adaptation
#####################
-Markdown reports
-Progress in ROOT user folder, tab separated. Percentage xx% State description and number(?)
-First run must have already been done for node to be able to run miRPursuit or else get a work around to say yes and accept conditions.

-Dealing with errors. How to highlight errors. Parse global log or run log for warnings. Set logs to have warnings or fatal warnings whatever. 


Global Issues
#############
miRPursuit is not designed for concurrent runs on the same machine.
For concurrent runs: 
	on the same machine it should be encapsulated in a docker image.
	Spin up another copy of this vm. Or a vm only with 


Standards
#########
Progress
	Percentage: xx% 
	State: Short description (Limited chars #not defined yet) 
	and number(?)
RUN ID
	Not sure what is the requirement of uniqueness. Unique to machine, database? Depends on deployment strategy.






Console
========

var exec = require('child_process').exec;
function log(error, stdout, stderr) { console.log(stdout) }
exec("ls -la", log);
