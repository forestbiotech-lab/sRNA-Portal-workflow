The plant sRNA portal is a a database of annotated sRNAs integrating the [miRPursuit](https://github.com/forestbiotech-lab/miRPursuit) pipeline to identify, predict and annotate plant small RNAs (sRNA).


- **Stage 1**:
	- Exposure of [miRNA data in our databases](/db). [See list of species](/stats/organism).
- **Stage 2** (Coming soon):
	- Running the pipeline and exporting to the database.

##### Currently we are at stage 2.
We are already providing access to the database but we are still testing the importation process of data from miRPursuit. 
As new features are added they will appear on the sidebar, on the left side of your browser.  

If you have suggestions or issues please post them on our github [page](https://github.com/forestbiotech-lab/sRNA-Portal-workflow/issues).
Stay posted updates coming soon.
