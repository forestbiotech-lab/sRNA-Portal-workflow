The plant sRNA portal is an online resource integrating a workflow (miRPursuit) for identifying, predicting and annotating plant small RNAs (sRNA), and a database to store the annotated sRNAs. 
The workflow miRPursuit is based on publicly available tools and allows the automated sequential application of data processing modules for analysis of sRNA datasets, including data preprocessing, filtering, annotation and reporting output. Additionally, tools for downstream analysis, such as expression matrix and prediction of sRNA target genes are integrated in the workflow.
