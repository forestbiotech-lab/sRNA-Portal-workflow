The plant sRNA portal is an online resource integrating a pipeline (miRPursuit) to identify, predict and annotate plant small RNAs (sRNA), and a database to store the annotated sRNAs. 

The pipeline miRPursuit is based on publicly available tools and allows the automated sequential application of data processing modules for analysis of sRNA datasets, including data preprocessing, filtering, annotation and reporting output. Additionally, tools for downstream analysis, visualization and curation will become available.

- **Stage 1**:
	- Exposure of miRNA data in our databases.
- **Stage 2** (Coming soon):
	- Running the pipeline and exporting to the database.

##### Currently we are at stage 2.
We are already providing access to the database and testing the importation process of data from the pipeline. 
As new features are added they will appear on the sidebar, on the left side of your browser.  

If you have suggestions of issues please post them on our github [page](https://github.com/forestbiotech-lab/sRNA-Portal-workflow/issues).
Stay posted updates coming soon.
