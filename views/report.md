The plant sRNA portal is an online resource integrating a workflow (miRPursuit) for identifying, predicting and annotating plant small RNAs (sRNA), and a database to store the annotated sRNAs. 
The workflow miRPursuit is based on publicly available tools and allows the automated sequential application of data processing modules for analysis of sRNA datasets, including data preprocessing, filtering, annotation and reporting output. Additionally, tools for downstream analysis, such as expression matrix and prediction of sRNA target genes are integrated in the workflow. 
The database will work as a repository of the miRPursuit annotated sRNAs and other publicly available sRNAs, focusing mainly on woody plant data. 
The portal web interface will allow users to access miRPursuit analysis pipeline and to search for annotated sRNAs based on specified parameters allowed in the user-friendly search interface.
The advantages of this resource are to facilitate integrated plant sRNA dataset analysis by providing a set of interconnected tools that are run in an automated manner for users with less bioinformatics training.
