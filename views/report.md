The plant sRNA portal provides a database of sRNAs annotated by the [miRPursuit](https://github.com/forestbiotech-lab/miRPursuit) pipeline. It is designed to provide a GUI, to interact with results and perfom further research on the annotated data. It comprises several tools to integrate external information, aid the visualization of the results, and predict miRNA targets and functions. 

The following use cases are available:

  * **Import annotated sequences** - Upload to you personal area the results of a miRPursuit run.
  * **Integrate predicted targets** - You can upload a list of targets for your annotated sRNA sequences 


If you have suggestions or issues please post them on our github [page](https://github.com/forestbiotech-lab/sRNA-Portal-workflow/issues).
Stay posted updates coming soon.
